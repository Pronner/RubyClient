Ruby is a Minecraft: Java Edition client created for mods, cosmetics, chats and more. It has a rich and comforting design with the newest posts about what's happening or what's new.

## Why it's so good

Ruby Client offers features that keep you going performance-wise and customization-wise, with mods, cosmetics, chats, rich presence, customizable settings and much, much more. It also automatically updates when a version is found even when it is hidden and can detect all your computer specifications to make sure everything runs well.

## Usage

What you are allowed to do:

```
- Update/modify the launcher for personal use
- Create a fork and then submit a pull request for an unsolved & open issue
- Use it like a regular person would
```

What you're not allowed to do:

```
- Sell the client/launcher or source code for personal goods or for a currency
- Modify the launcher, publicly distribute it and call it yours
```
